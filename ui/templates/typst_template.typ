- Writing lists in a simple way is great.
- Nothing complex, start your points with `-`
  and this will become a list.
  - Indented lists are created via indentation.

+ Numbered lists start with `+` instead of `-`.
+ There is no alternative markup syntax for lists
+ So just remember `-` and `+`, all other symbols
  wouldn't work in an unintended way.
  + That is a general property of Typst's markup.
  + Unlike Markdown, there is only one way
    to write something with it.


I will just mention math ($a + b/c = sum_i x^i$)
is possible and quite pretty there:

$
7.32 beta +
  sum_(i=0)^nabla
    (Q_i (a_i - epsilon)) / 2
$
